# Mervin-YelpCamp
A Yelp-inspired application for Campgrounds. 
A Node application for sharing campgrounds and
reviews.
Implemented CRUD and geoJSON
features with Express, MongoDB, and Passport.

This version of YelpCamp is my own code inspired from Colt Steele's YelpCamp project from his 2020 Web Development Boot Camp.
