# Mervin-YelpCamp
A Yelp-inspired application for campgrounds. 
A Node application for sharing campgrounds and
reviews.
Implemented CRUD, geoJSON, and other features with
Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Cloudinary, Mapbox, and Passport.

This version of YelpCamp is my own code inspired by Colt Steele's YelpCamp project from his 2020 Web Development Boot Camp.
